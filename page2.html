<div class="er"><p>In my opinion, Doudian's marketing model has two advantages. First of all, Doudian can find the potential needs of users through big data. Users can find suitable products through various short video contents in Douyin, become interested in them, and guide consumers to buy on the platform. Therefore, I think such a sales process is more efficient. Secondly, for businesses, the needs of consumers have been tapped, and the sales channels have also carried out more accurate guidance through the platform to help businesses Contact consumers, so as to realize the characteristics of higher convenience. <br>
  But Doudian also has some disadvantages. I think he ignores Douyin users' right of independent choice. First, Doudian is the e-commerce module under the Douyin platform. Some Douyin users do not want to see short videos with consumption guidance when using the app. However, there is no obvious non e-commerce partition in today's Douyin app, which makes users may not get a good experience when using it. I think this is what Douyin needs to improve in the future. </p>
